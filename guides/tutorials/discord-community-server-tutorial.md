### Release Patch Updates

Give your community a professional experience by enabling a webhook for GitHub releases in an Announcements channel.  Announcements channels allow other servers to follow your posts so this is a great way to spread the word and let other communities know when you a new release for them to check out.  This feature leverages the comments you provide when you merge your pull request on GitHub so there's no additional work required.
