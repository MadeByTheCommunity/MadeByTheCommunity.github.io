# Made By The Community

## Better Together

**This project is based on the belief that what we make is made better when we share and work together.**&#x20;

The objective of this project is to create a community where [Citizen Developers](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] collaborate, establish standards, and share ideas. Doing this enhances the unique value of each project and the benefit these projects provide to the Citizens[^2] in the community.

If you are developing a [Star Citizen](#user-content-fn-3)[^3]_®_ mod or app or are considering beginning a project to do so, please take a couple minutes to read this:
