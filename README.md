# MadeByTheCommunity.dev

## Better Together

This project is based on the belief that what we make is made better when we share and work together.&#x20;

Creating a community where Community Developers collaborate, establish standards, and share ideas enhances the unique value of each project and the benefit these projects provide to the Citizens in the community.

If you are considering starting (or already do) development of a mod or app for Star Citizen, please take a couple minutes to read this.
