# Repositories

## Choose an Open Repository&#x20;

Why choose an [open repository](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] to organize your code? Many other community developers have already leveraged [open repositories](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] and it will make collaborating (forking, branching, issues and pull requests) a breeze in the long run.

### GitHub

In their own words: "_GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses_ [_Git_](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git) _for versioning._" Their focus on collaboration shows up as [the GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). "_GitHub flow is useful for everyone, not just developers_." As a open repository GitHub provides many free and paid for services for your development projects.&#x20;

With a GitHub [personal account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-products#github-free-for-personal-accounts), you can create unlimited public repositories and have unlimited collaborators work with you on them. There are many features available with a free personal account and only a few limitations based on [account type](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts) or to use [paid services](https://github.com/pricing). You can read more in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

### GitLab

In their own words: "_GitLab is the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps Platform._" This gives you some idea of the company's focus and the services you will find there.  As an open repository GitLab provides free and paid for services for your development needs.&#x20;

With a GitLab [free account](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) you can get essential features for an individual user. Additional features are available in [paid for tiers](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/premium/) and the overall offering is slightly different than GitHub. You can read more in the [GitLab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/).

### BitBucket

This is a unique offering from Atlassian and is paired closely with their other products like Jira and Trello. In their own words: "_We provide one place for your team to collaborate on code from concept to Cloud, build quality code through automated testing, and deploy code_" You can get a[ free personal account](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/pricing) or make a small team of up to 5 users and use many of the features. Some additional CI/CD features will require you to upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/pricing#standard-or-premium).

You can read more in the [BitBucket docs](https://bitbucket.org/product/guides).
